# 🌟 Fred's Portfolio

Welcome to my digital garden — a frontend portfolio crafted with care using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org). This space is where my code and creativity meet, built to showcase my projects, my learning journey, and the joy of building things on the web.

This project was bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) and embraces the power of modern web development.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run the development server locally:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

```

Once the server is running, open your browser and head over to:

👉 [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

You can start editing the homepage by modifying the `app/page.tsx` file. Your changes will be reflected instantly thanks to hot reloading.
